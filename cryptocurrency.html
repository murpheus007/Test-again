               <p>
                  In late 2008, Bitcoin was launched as the first cryptocurrency
                  and was intended to be the future of money. Several
                  cryptocurrencies have since sprung up, and while most of them
                  have attractive monetary qualities, investors have
                  particularly been concerned with their characteristics as a
                  digital store of value. This is why many investors nowadays
                  seek avenues of trading cryptocurrencies.
               </p>

               <h3>What is Cryptocurrency Trading?</h3>
               <p>
                  Cryptocurrencies carry inherent value, and this has made them
                  legitimate financial assets that can be bought and sold for
                  profit. Based on this, cryptocurrency trading is the buying
                  and selling of various coins or tokens with the aim of
                  generating a profit. Investors can trade various
                  cryptocurrencies via a crypto exchange or a CFD brokerage
                  firm, such as Finnaprotrade.
               </p>
               <p>
                  When you trade via an exchange, you will need to create an
                  exchange account as well as open a crypto wallet where you
                  will be storing your coins. With an exchange, you own actual
                  coins in digital form and must store them securely. You will
                  generate a profit when the value of the underlying coin you
                  are holding increases and you sell the coins at a higher price
                  than that which you had initially bought for. If you sell at a
                  price lower than the buying price, you incur losses.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In contrast, with a CFD brokerage like
                  <strong>Vaultrise</strong>, you do not own the actual
                  cryptocurrency. Instead, you speculate on price movements.
                  Profits are made when your prediction is correct, and losses
                  occur when it is not.
               </p>
               <p>
                  CFDs present an attractive method of trading volatile crypto
                  markets, offering benefits such as leverage.
                  <strong>Vaultrise</strong> enables you to trade top
                  cryptocurrencies under competitive conditions, with low
                  spreads and the flexibility to speculate on both rising and
                  falling markets.

            <h3>What Do Cryptocurrency Miners Do?</h3>
            <p>
               Cryptocurrencies operate like digital cash but are created
               through a process akin to gold mining. Crypto miners validate
               transactions on the blockchain, ensuring the security and
               integrity of the network. This process is known as mining.
            </p>
            <p>
               As transactions occur globally, miners use computing power to
               verify and add them to the public ledger. Once confirmed, these
               records cannot be altered. In return, miners receive newly minted
               coins, introducing more cryptocurrency into circulation.
            </p>
            <p>
               Many cryptocurrencies have a fixed supply. For instance, the
               total supply of Bitcoin is capped, with the last coin expected to
               be mined by the year 2140. This scarcity places demand as a key
               factor in determining price.
            </p>
            <p>
               Bitcoin, the first and most prominent cryptocurrency, remains the
               benchmark for the industry. However, many others have gained
               significant adoption, including Ethereum, Ripple, Dash, Litecoin,
               NEO, EOS, Stellar Lumens, as well as forks like Bitcoin Cash and
               Bitcoin Gold.

         <div class="crypto-container-none crypto-text">
            <h3>Blockchain – The Technology Behind Cryptocurrencies</h3>
            <p>
               Unlike traditional financial transactions, cryptocurrency
               exchanges do not require intermediaries such as banks or
               financial institutions. Every transaction is permanently recorded
               on a public digital ledger called the blockchain.
            </p>

            <h4>What is a Blockchain?</h4>
            <p>
               A blockchain is an open, digital, and distributed ledger that
               stores transaction records in a secure, transparent, and
               decentralized way. It acts as a public database not governed by
               any single entity. The blockchain is made up of numerous
               'blocks', which are encrypted collections of transaction data
               linked sequentially.
            </p>
            <p>
               When a new block is created, it is broadcast to the network.
               Users verify the block, and once validated, it becomes part of
               the blockchain. Each cryptocurrency has its own blockchain,
               powered by complex computer-generated algorithms. To interact
               with a blockchain, a user must have a cryptocurrency wallet (also
               called an e-wallet).
            </p>

            <h4>What is a Cryptocurrency Wallet?</h4>
            <p>
               A cryptocurrency wallet is a software or hardware tool that
               allows you to store, receive, and send digital currencies. Think
               of it as your personal crypto bank account. Most wallets are
               coin-specific—Bitcoin wallets handle only Bitcoin, while Ethereum
               wallets are exclusively for Ether.
            </p>
            <p>
               Each wallet is encrypted and unique to its owner. When funds are
               sent, an encrypted message is broadcast to the recipient, which
               can only be decrypted by the recipient’s wallet. Crypto wallets
               come in two main forms: hardware (physical) and software
               (digital).

            <h4>Why are Cryptos Ideal for Trading?</h4>
            <p>
               Cryptocurrencies have become a valuable component of modern
               investment portfolios. Their prices are largely influenced by
               demand and supply rather than traditional economic indicators or
               political events. In 2017, Bitcoin captured mainstream attention
               by surpassing the value of an ounce of gold.
            </p>
            <p>
               This sparked institutional interest, prompted governments to
               explore digital currencies, and accelerated blockchain adoption.
               Cryptocurrency derivatives were introduced, expanding access and
               utility. During the 2020 global lockdown, people witnessed
               firsthand the flaws of fiat currencies as governments printed
               money to counter economic downturns.
            </p>
            <p>
               As digital stores of value, cryptocurrencies have consistently
               outperformed traditional assets. Their appeal continues to grow,
               offering a new, high-volatility investment vehicle available for
               trading around the clock—even on weekends.

            <h3>Leveraged Cryptocurrency Trading</h3>
            <p>
               On Wall Street, most crashes have been triggered and worsened by
               leverage. The same applies to cryptocurrencies, where recent
               months have witnessed massive drops in nearly all coins and
               tokens—excluding Stablecoins. Bitcoin fell from around $65,000 to
               $30,000 and struggled to reclaim the $40,000 level as of July
               2021.
            </p>
            <p>
               Ethereum similarly declined from around $4,400 to $1,700. Other
               tokens saw losses as steep as 80% within just weeks of hitting
               their all-time highs.
            </p>
            <p>
               One of the major contributing factors to this decline was the
               widespread availability of leveraged crypto trading. Leverage
               allows investors to amplify gains, but also significantly
               magnifies losses—especially in the highly volatile crypto market.
               While professionals may understand and manage these risks, retail
               traders often do not.
            </p>
            <p>
               During the COVID-19 pandemic, many retail traders entered the
               market searching for new income streams. While institutions
               triggered the late-2020 and early-2021 bull run, retail traders
               helped drive it further with leveraged bets.
            </p>
            <p>
               However, the same leverage also accelerated the crash. Today,
               leveraged crypto trading can drive trends, intensify volatility,
               and extend price cycles. For professional traders, this presents
               both opportunity and additional risk.
            </p>

                     Are cryptocurrencies more volatile than forex?

                     <p>
                        Cryptocurrency markets exhibit much higher volatility
                        than traditional forex. Volatility measures how much
                        prices move over time. While forex rates do fluctuate,
                        it’s nowhere near the extreme price swings seen in
                        crypto. For example, Bitcoin’s price went from $693 in
                        2016 to $58,000 in May 2021—showing a much steeper rise
                        than typical currency pairs.

                     Is retail ownership of cryptocurrencies greater than
                     institutional ownership?
                  </button>
                  <div class="faq-answer">
                     <p>
                        Yes, most cryptocurrencies are owned by retail
                        investors. While high-profile institutions and
                        individuals like Elon Musk have entered the space,
                        retail traders dominate the market. For instance,
                        according to bitinfocharts.com, 133,304 accounts hold
                        85% of all Bitcoin wealth (between 10 to 100 BTC per
                        account). Out of 21 million BTC total supply, 18.6
                        million are already in circulation with only 900 mined
                        daily.
